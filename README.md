# Transatlantic long-haul fight analysis

This repository contains the work from my internship at ATSLab, where I studied the factors influencing the opening of direct long-haul routes on the transatlantic market.

## Repository structure
      
* `analysis/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for the main analyses:
    - Global analysis of newly opened routes
    - Comparative studies
    - A filtering notebook for routes
    - A Python script with custom plotting functions
* `data_processing/`: Notebooks dedicated to importing, preprocessing, modifying, and enriching the data to make it ready for analysis.
* `data_scraping/`: Includes few web scrapers (Google ratings, Wikipedia, World Bank, US BEA) and the corresponding extracted CSV files.
* `report/`: Contains the internship report (in progress), earlier drafts and a folder with the figures.

Enjoy!
